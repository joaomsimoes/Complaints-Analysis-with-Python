# Complaints-Analysis-with-Python

Portal da Queixa is a website where you can express your complaints directly to the brand. The Portuguese community actively uses it, and you can extract a lot of information using NLP methods.
<br><br>
With this scraper, I want to analyse complaints from the different companies. Then, using some NLP techniques, it is possible to have some insights.
This project is divided into two sections:

  1. The Scrapper to save the data in a database
  2. The Streamlit App to do the analysis


Before building the app I did an exploratory data analysis to try to see which techniques I could use.

<br><br>
For this project I used the [Blueprints for Text Analytics Using Python](https://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Text-Analytics-Using-Python/dp/149207408X/) as a guide.
