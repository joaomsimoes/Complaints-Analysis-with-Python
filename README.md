#Complaints-Analysis-with-Python

With this scrapper I want to analyse complaints from the different companies. Using some NLP techniques it is possible to have some insights.
This project is divided in two sections:

  1. The Scrapper to save the data in a database
  2. The Streamlit App to do the analysis


Before building the app to analyse more brands I did a first exploratory data analysis.
