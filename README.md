# Complaints-Analysis-with-Python

With this scrapper I want to analyse complaints from the different companies. Using some NLP techniques it is possible to have some insights.
This project is divided in two sections:

  1. The Scrapper to save the data in a database
  2. The Streamlit App to do the analysis


Before building the app I did an exploratory data analysis to try to see which techniques I could use.

For this project I used the [Blueprints for Text Analytics Using Python](https://www.amazon.com/Blueprints-Text-Analytics-Using-Python/dp/149207408X/) as a guide.
